An Interactive Desktop Application for Cell Segmentation and Single-Cell Morphological Parameter Extraction

"Toggle-Untoggle" workflow:

2. Segments cells in the images using the Cellpose Cyto3 generalist model
3. Extracts morphological parameters and/or ROIs from the selected cells
4. Saves the output to the same folder as the input images
